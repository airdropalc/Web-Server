# üåê Simple Vanilla Web Server

Welcome to our community's web server project! This repository serves two primary goals:

1.  **A Practical Tool:** To provide a simple, lightweight web server for hosting and downloading files needed by our community.
2.  **An Educational Example:** To serve as a clear reference for anyone wanting to learn how to build a basic web server from scratch using "vanilla" technology, without relying on heavy frameworks.

## üç¶ What Does "Vanilla" Mean?

This is a great question! In software development, the term **"vanilla"** refers to using a technology in its most basic, pure, and unadorned form, without any additional libraries, frameworks, or plugins.

Think of it like vanilla ice cream‚Äîit's the standard, original flavor before you add any toppings or syrups (which would be the frameworks and libraries).

For this web server project, "vanilla" means we are building it using only the core, built-in modules that come with the programming language itself (for example, the `http` module in Node.js or `http.server` in Python). We are intentionally **not** using popular frameworks like Express.js, Fastify, Django, or Flask.

The benefit of this approach is that it helps you understand the fundamental principles of how a web server works under the hood.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this server on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/airdropalc/Web-Server.git
cd Web-Server
```

**2. Add Your Files**
Place any files you want to share or host into the `public/` directory.

**3. Run the Server**
Execute the main script from your terminal.
```bash
npm run dev
```
You should see a message in your console, such as `Server running at http://localhost:8080`. You can now access your files through your web browser at that address.
